## Game Mechanic

Two players (PvP or PvE) go against each other in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers (nests), with the destruction of "King's Nest" being an instantaneous win.
The game is 3-minute long with a possible 2-minute sudden-death and tie-breakers based on nests' healthpoints.
During the fight, players will be able to deploy their dinosaurs from their decks using meat points (which replenish over time) in order to attack opponents' nests or defend against opponents' dinosaurs.

## Target audience

- Gamers interested in Card Collectible and Tower Rush Games
- Crypto enthusiasts.
