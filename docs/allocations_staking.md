# Staking Rewards

We also provides staking rewards, but our staking mechanism is quite different.

You can stake your Dinos enabling other player to use your Dinos in their deck which nets you percentage of their earned battle rewards. This system is in place to cover the case when floor Dinos are too expensive to buy for new players.
